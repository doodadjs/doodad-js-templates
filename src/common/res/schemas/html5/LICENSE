NOTES
=====
There is no official schemas for HTML 5 !!! It's because of the special attribute "data-*" which can't be validated and other non-compliant features. 
The W3C simply forgot that we need auto-completion and validation when they did HTML5 ! So I did a short schema (html5.xsd) for HTML elements and a 
DTD (html5.dtd) for the entities.
